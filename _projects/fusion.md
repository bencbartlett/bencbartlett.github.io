During middle and high school, I built a variation on the design for a [Farnsworth Fusor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusor), which is an inertial electrostatic confinement device that can act as a weak neutron source by fusing small quantities of deuterium ions. I used my reactor to perform a series of rudimentary experiments for [Intel ISEF](https://www.societyforscience.org/isef/) which demonstrated a method of neutron collimation by using an additional ion gun to impart a velocity differential in the deuterium ions, skewing the momentum distribution of the neutrons produced in the fusion reactions. Here are a couple of old photos of the reactor.
