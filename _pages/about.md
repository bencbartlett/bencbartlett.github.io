I'm currently a quantum computer architect at [PsiQuantum](https://www.psiquantum.com/) working to design a scalable and fault-tolerant photonic quantum computer. I have a [PhD](/assets/pdf/Ben_Bartlett_PhD_Dissertation.pdf) in applied physics from Stanford University, where I worked on [programmable photonics](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.101.042319) for [quantum information processing](https://opg.optica.org/optica/fulltext.cfm?uri=optica-8-12-1515&id=465446) and ultra high-speed [machine learning](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade8450). Most of my research sits at the intersection of nanophotonics, quantum physics, and machine learning, and basically consists of me designing little race tracks for photons that trick them into doing useful computations.

During my PhD I was an AI resident at [Google X](https://x.company/), working on an undisclosed project involving electromagnetics, machine learning, and distributed computing. Before that I earned an MS in electrical engineering from Stanford and a BS in physics and computer science from Caltech. If you're interested, here is my [resume](/assets/pdf/Ben_Bartlett_Resume.pdf)/[CV](/assets/pdf/Ben_Bartlett_CV.pdf).

When not I'm trying to trick photons into thinking or making GPUs go brr, you can probably find me playing [piano](/projects/piano), making [math animations](/math-animations), doing [LED art projects](/projects/led), blogging about [technical stuff](/blog), working on random [coding projects](https://github.com/bencbartlett), or just vibing with my [cat](/assets/img/cat.jpg).
