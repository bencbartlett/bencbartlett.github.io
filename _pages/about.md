I am a San Francisco-based physicist currently working as a researcher at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) on massive distributed computing problems. I have a [PhD](/assets/pdf/Ben_Bartlett_PhD_Dissertation.pdf) in applied physics from Stanford University, where I designed programmable [photonic computers](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.101.042319) for [quantum information processing](https://opg.optica.org/optica/fulltext.cfm?uri=optica-8-12-1515&id=465446) and ultra high-speed [machine learning](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade8450). 
<!-- Most of my research sits at the intersection of nanophotonics, quantum physics, and machine learning, and basically consists of designing little race tracks for photons that trick them into doing useful computations.  -->
If you're interested, here is my [resume](/assets/pdf/Ben_Bartlett_Resume.pdf)/[CV](/assets/pdf/Ben_Bartlett_CV.pdf).

Outside of research, I am also an artist working primarily with LEDs and kinetic sculptures. I'm best known for [Event Horizon](https://www.eventhorizon.art/): a colossal three-story tall motorized gyroscope with over a mile of LEDs, built at Burning Man 2025. I've also made a number of smaller art pieces and a have another large one in the works. My pieces use a custom software stack I wrote and all incorporate synchronized light and motion.

When I'm not making GPU clusters go brr or building huge LED sculptures, you can probably find me playing [piano](/projects/piano), blogging about [technical stuff](/blog), making [math animations](/math-animations), working on random [coding projects](https://github.com/bencbartlett), or just vibing with my [cat](/assets/img/cat.jpg).
