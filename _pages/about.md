I'm a quantum computer architect at [PsiQuantum](https://www.psiquantum.com/) working to design a scalable and fault-tolerant photonic quantum computer. I have a [Ph.D. in applied physics](/assets/pdf/Ben_Bartlett_PhD_Disertation.pdf) from Stanford University, where I worked on [programmable photonics](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.101.042319) for [quantum information processing](https://opg.optica.org/optica/fulltext.cfm?uri=optica-8-12-1515&id=465446) and ultra high-speed [machine learning](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade8450). 

During my Ph.D. I was an AI resident at [Google X](https://x.company/), working on an undisclosed project involving electromagnetics, machine learning, and distributed computing. Prior to that I earned an MS in electrical engineering from Stanford and a BS in physics and computer science from Caltech.

My research focuses on optical computing architectures for classical and quantum information. Programmable on-chip interferometers can perform high-throughput and energy-efficient matrix computations and provide a promising hardware platform for machine learning. I have also worked on extending programmable optics to the quantum domain with an architecture for photonic quantum programmable gate arrays which can be reprogrammed to perform arbitrary quantum computations and have proposed a photonic quantum computer architecture which requires only a single controllable qubit.

Prior to coming to Stanford, I developed a popular quantum network simulation framework, wrote a functional testing system for camera subsystems on the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, worked on vertex reconstruction algorithms for the Large Hadron Collider, and studied the evolution of the Earth's rotation.
